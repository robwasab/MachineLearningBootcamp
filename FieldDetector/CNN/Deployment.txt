The field detector will ultimately be deployed on an embedded signal processor.
However, for the scope of this project, the detector will be deployed as a
local Python signal processing program that uses numpy libraries to perform
digital signal processing and neural network evaluation. This is an intermediate
step since the final produce must be converted to a C program.

The field detector must run in real time and provide low latency detections in
order to quickly shut off RF radiation. Therefore, distributed processing via
cloud and REST apis is not viable.
